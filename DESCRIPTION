Description: Provides methods for selecting the optimal bandwidth in kernel density estimation for dependent samples, such as those generated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Implements a modified biased cross-validation (mBCV) approach that accounts for sample dependence, improving the accuracy of estimated density functions.
